## Portfolio
This is a start to what will become my professional portfolio used to house examples of websites and apps I have coded to potential employers.

## Purpose
Create a site to showcase work I have compelted and use, the site itself will need to look and function well. This is being completed as part of MSUs coding bootcamp. While I should add my own flair to the site, it should share similar functionality to the example target mock-up that was provided:
